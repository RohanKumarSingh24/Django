    "# The range is an inbuilt function that generates the list. It creates a static list before running the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let’s take an example of range(1, 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note: We are only passing two parameters. By default step-parameter value is 1. So, while each iteration, \n",
    "#       the value is incremented by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It creates the list of size 9 having elements 1 to 9 (9 inclusive) and returns list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# xrabge():\n",
    "# Unlike range, xrange returns xrange sequence object.\n",
    "# It doesn’t create a list and each sequence element is evaluated lazily during each iteration. \n",
    "# In other words, next iteration is similar to the returning last_value+1.\n",

    "# It evaluates each element in the sequence and returns values from 1 to 9 (9 inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The xrange() is an another generator and the value is created using a special technique called as yielding. \n",
    "# For more detail, you can read generator function and yield value in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# As range() created a list of all the elements and save it before iterating. Whereas, xrange does not \n",
    "# saves any element and evaluate each element during each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, range() takes more memory to save these elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Which is faster?\n",
    "# Running xrange() is slower as compared to the range() as xrange evaluates the value of element during each iteration. \n",
    "# It is also called as lazy evaluation.\n",

    "# If you are performing an action on very large range elements, it is good to use xrange(). \n",
